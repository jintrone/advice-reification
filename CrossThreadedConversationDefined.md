1. Posts are refining advice about roughly the same concept.
2. Posts proceed in a sequence across forums, not within forums.
3. Posts, when strung together, do not constitute 'turn taking'.
4. References are not maintained across posts.
5. More than viral diffusion of an internet meme or video, and less than a conversation that is intended to coordinate understanding about a specific topic.
6. Cross threaded conversation is an acyclic graph. Each post has 4 features:
  - time
  - thread in which it appears
  - identity of poster
  - topic
7. A potential for transfer exists any time
  - two people participate in a single thread and
  - then the latter person subsequently posts in a different thread about the topic originally posted by the former person.
  - there is some period of time, after which transfer is unlikely because the number of threads and conversations that have taken place exceeds any reasonable expectation that somebody would recall the prior thread.
