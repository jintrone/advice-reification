## Notes on Analysis
1. All the functions that are essential for qualitative analysis are in main.R or called from [main.R](./main.R)
2. [qual-graphs.R](./qual-graphs.R) calls functions in main.R and iterates through all of the forums -- 23 total -- that are in the paper, producing data that includes adjacency information for each note in each component. 
3. The task of identifying qualitative examples to support our algorithm will focus on components of sizes larger than 4.
4. The output of the [qual-graphs.R](./qual-graphs.R) data is loaded into a mysql database by: 
  - First, munging all the output files from each of the 23 forums together, using [make-qual-data.R](./make-qual-data.R)
  - Second, using data loading facilities in navicat to load the data into a table
5. We then query the mysql database to extract two key pieces of information: 
  - Forum post text in original form, but only for components with 4 or more members.  Most of the components have only 2 posts, and we view these as probabilistically less likely to produce a useful result than the longer chains.  This is nominally supported by our LIWC analysis, which shows that longer topic threads produce more information. 
  - The list of adjancies for each component that can then be coded as connected








## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
